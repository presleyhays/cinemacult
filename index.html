        <h2>History of Cinema</h2>
        <p> Cinema emerged in the late 19th centery as invetors experiemented with capturing and projecting moving images. 
          Early breakthroughs included sequential motion photography, such as Eadweard Muybridge's experiments in the 1870s, which demonstrated how rapid image series could simulate motion. 
          The true turrning point came in 1895, when the Lumiere brothers held the first commercial public screening of short films in Paris, establishing cinema as a new form of mass entertainment. 
          These early films were brief, silent, and shot from a fixed camera, yet they quickly captivated audiences around the world. 
          By the 20th centery, studios formed, narrative filmmaking expanded, and international film movements began shaping cinematic language. 
          Over time, innovations such a synchonized sound, color processing, special effects, and digitial technology transformed film into a global art form and industry, continually redefining how stories are created and expereinced.</p>
